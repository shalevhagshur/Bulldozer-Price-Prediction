# 🚜 Bulldozer Sale Price Prediction
This project builds a regression model to predict the sale price of bulldozers based on historical data. It leverages Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to create a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.


# 📖 About the Project
The Bulldozer Sale Price Prediction project focuses on building a machine learning regression model to forecast the future sale price of bulldozers. The model uses historical sales data and applies preprocessing techniques before training the model.
